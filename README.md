# DomoKodi
Domoticz addon for Kodi
Create scenes in Domoticz for play, pause and stop
Examples: play scene would dim the lights and close the shades, the pause scene would ramp up lights to 40%, and stop would ramp lights up to 100% and open the shades
Install the addon in Kodi and configure you Domoticaz server settings: IP, port. Do not set a user or password as this function does not work. I found it easier to just bypass authentication by adding the local machine(s) running Kodi in the Domoticz's settings.   
Configure scene setting information
Configure night mode - night mode is optional however this is use to prevent scenes from being activated during day light hours.
Disable and then re-enable the addon in Kodi to initiate the settings

Enjoy

FYI: Advanced Kodi users can use a keymap to display a custum menu that can be configured as well.
